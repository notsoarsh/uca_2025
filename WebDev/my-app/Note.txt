When we want to install global dependencies use a -g flag along with npm

//Public directory 
Used for keeping the sharable files, say images, etc.

//Eslint.config used for the fomatting and linitng for project

//package.json contains the project configs, like scripts , dependencies

//npx - node package executor

//jsonconfig file mentions the path that says that we have an alias , for the root that has the compilable code


//next.config.js - used for using internal features of nextjs

//favicon- favourite icons , used for telling the hero icon and most of the framework understand


//In the prev versions of nextjs there was an explicit index.html file but now it creates internally
//Corresponding to the index file , we have *layout.js*, that serves as the entry point for project

//next dev - builds the project and hosts it on a node server, build means it may transpile js code or create a server that runs the code

//Jo folder bnaenge jisme page.js hoga , uska name will be used a 'route' and nextjs will try to find the page.js file

//hum anchor tags use kr skte lekin this causes new call to server for rendering
//SPA - Single page application

//Hum 'children' ko change krre witht the component we want


//PRE-FETCHING - 

 What’s actually happening under the hood:

When the page first loads:

The server renders React Server Components (RSC) into a lightweight JSON format (Flight data).

That data is used to generate HTML (SSR) for the first request.

The browser hydrates the page.

When you click a <Link> (client-side navigation):

The browser sends a fetch request to the server for that route.

The server returns Flight data (JSON) for only the changed parts of the component tree.

The browser merges that into the existing React tree — no full reload.

That’s why Next.js feels fast — it’s not sending entire HTML again, just structured JSON updates for the components.


//External urls are not prefetched but internals can be

Hydration (Browser side pr hta h)- server side render and client side render ko combine krke browser pe show kanra ui so that we get a consistent ui

Pre-fetching -  Server side vala part krvalo when we are on a page , and when its requested to usko attach krdo csr se and ui mei render kvado
// Since humne ssr ko pehle hi perform krdia to iss client side ki performance bad gyi kyuki sirf kam ui render krne ka reh gya hydration dwara
uss page ki rendering nhi slow karega as rendering tabhi hogi jab link dikhnge and that would be after rendering
uske baad load bhad jaega uspr due to prefetching on the initial render
prefetching is just moving rendering part to an early stage

//npm run build - runs the command in production mode rather than dev mode

//When it is in dev mode , it compiles at runtime when required but when in production mode it compiles everything before

//event handlers are browser events so it cant run on nodejs, so since server side requires node , it has to be rendered by browser , hence client side

//useEffect is primarily client side


//nextjs is a framework and a library as well, which binds the complete process to provide ssr

--------------CSS----------------

CSS selectors Specificity

p1 - pclass-abcd
p2 - pclass-asdw
p3 - pclass-wert

//Here we are saying we allocate dynamic class names at run time - Bootstrap , Tailwind etc. , but this is not to be done !!!!!

//margin can be negative padding can not be

//Default export has to be one, but normal exports can be many but we need to use same name

//Next js uses file based routing , where it calls different pages across the app in the main layout using the paths


//jaha bhi we want to use a react hook, it has to be csr


//Await is used for achieving sleep functionality , waits for the async code for being completed


//We use suspense component of react if we want to show something before component render
//it has a prop "fallback" - that defines what to show


Server side rendering- 
 - ON DEMAND + some caching  
 - 2 types 
 - With caching - 
 -Without caching -
 - PRE render -- For pages that are not often changed 

- Jo bhi user interactive pages hote jisme client side kaam zyada hota, idhr CSR is better.
