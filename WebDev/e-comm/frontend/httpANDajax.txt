//Uses TCP-IP way of communication
//TCP breaks packet at sender sir and combines at reciever
//Ip used for dest to source msg , adds target ip

 * 2xx Success - The action was success
 * 3xx Redirection - Further action must be taken in order to complete the req
 * 4xx Client Side Error - The request contains bad syntax
