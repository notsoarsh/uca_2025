**** Backend Development ***
Nodejs - API Development
- Using express as well

- Response : 
  - success (200, 201, 202, 2xx, 204-empty Response browser doesnt download)
  - failure

** 20 Nov Thursday **
bson - Binary JSON , mongodb uses this to store(equivalent to json.stringify)

Database are basically files only.

//we dont necessarily want that we are making calls to the cache, we can store it in the memory ~ "caching"


// in mongodb we call tables as Collections. *** 

What is nodejs?
At root level its basically a process/service running in the backend 

//homework
put and delete method to be completed in the index

//middlewares in express
  - if before being handled by the server , we want any function to be performed on the req , we use middlewares 

22 November - 
  - Types of storage
    - Database  
    - File storage
    - Web storage
    - Peristent Data 

  Why we dont use body with Delete api , as everypart of an api is performed by different things/ layers, and for them the definition is defined for the particular protocol .

  ** GET request is by default cached
  ** You may use PUT to create new Data, but dont do this when id is not known
  ** Deserialisation - When data is converted from string to a format say JSON
  ** Serialisation - object to stringify


  writeFile - Async , writeFileSync - well self explanatory 

  ****
  arrayObj.findIndex((callback_param) => obj.prop = prop); returns the index for which the condition satisifies
  ** cors error is a browser error - one domain tries to access data from another domain
